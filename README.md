# The M Programming Language
The first programming language optimized for developing software from a mobile device. 

## What problem is this trying to solve?
Writing JavaScript, C, and most other conventional programming languages are cumbersome to write from a mobile keyboard. M solves this by having a syntax that is specialized for a mobile phone keyboard. For example, 
1. Since phones tend to start each new line with a capital, A capital letter (A-Z) denotes the beginning of a statement. 
2. `M` Avoids special characters that most languages rely on (&|{};), and prefers A-Z where possible. 

## Hello, world
```
Print "Hello, world"
```

## Math
```
Var sum = 5 + 5
Var product = sum * 10
```

## Logic
```
Var x = true
Var y = true
Var z = false
If x and y or z
Print "yay!!!!"
End
```

## Loops
### For loop
```
For i = 0; i < 10; i++
Print i
End
```
### While loop
```
While i < 10
Print i
// Note that variables are case insensitive, i == I
I += 1
End
```

## Functions
```
Fun add a, b
Return a + b
End
```

## Open Questions
1. How can we enable the user to run and debug their code from the phone? A solution might be a small website (like [repl](https://replit.com/)) that you can easily paste code snippets into and see output etc. 


## Request for Help
If you find m lang interesting, potentially useful, or a bit silly, contact me! You can find my email in my GitHub profile, just mention `m lang` or The M Programming Language, or something like that in the subject and I will respond as soon as possible. 

Thank you,
