# The M Programming Language
The first programming language optimized for developing software from a mobile device. 

## What problem is this trying to solve?
Writing JavaScript, C, and most other conventional programming languages are cumbersome to write from a mobile keyboard. Instead of making apps for coding on your phone, it sounds like way more fun to create a brand new programming language! 

## Guiding Principles
1. Avoid special characters (&^%$), prefer A-Z. Try to avoid too many taps to insert the specific character.
2. Since phones tend to Start each new line with a capital, perhaps we can use that to our advantage. A capital letter (A-Z) denotes the beginning of a statement.

## Hello, world
```
Print "Hello, world"
```

## Math
```
Var sum = 5 + 5
Var product = sum * 10
```

## Loops
### For loop
```
For i = 0; i < 10; i++
Print i
End
```
### While loop
```
While i < 10
Print i
// Note that variables are case insensitive, i == I
I += 1
End
```

## Functions
```
Fun add a, b
Return a + b
End
```

## Open Questions
1. How can we enable the user to run and debug their code from the phone? That might require an app to be honest.
