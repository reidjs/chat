# The M Programming Language
The first programming language optimized for developing software from a mobile device. 

## What problem is this trying to solve?
Writing JavaScript, C, and most other conventional programming languages are cumbersome to write from a mobile keyboard. M solves this by having a syntax that is specialized for a mobile phone keyboard. For example, 
1. Since phones tend to start each new line with a capital, A capital letter (A-Z) denotes the beginning of a statement. 
2. `M` Avoids special characters that most languages rely on (&|{};), and prefers A-Z where possible. 

## Hello, world
```
Print "Hello, world"
```

## Math
```
Sum is 5 plus 5
Var product is sum times 10
```

## Comments
```
Comment this line will be ignored because it starts with the word "comment"
```

```
Comments these lines will be ignored until the word end (with a capital e) because
the word comment is plural, "comments"
End
```

## Logic
```
X is true
Y is true
Z is false
Comment note that variables are case insensitive, X is the same as x
If x and y or z
Print "yay!!!!"
End
```

## Loops
### For loop
```
For i is 0, i less than 10, increase i
Print i
End
```
### While loop
```
While i less than 10
Print i
Comment note that variables are case insensitive, i == I
I += 1
End
```

## Functions
```
Fun add a, b
Return a + b
End
```

## Open Questions
How can we enable the user to run and debug their code from the phone?
  - A solution might be a website like [replit](https://replit.com/) that you can easily paste code snippets into and see the output. 


## Request for Help
If you find m lang interesting, potentially useful, or a bit silly, contact me! You can find my email in my GitHub profile, just mention `m lang` or The M Programming Language, or something like that in the subject and I will respond as soon as possible. 

Thank you,
